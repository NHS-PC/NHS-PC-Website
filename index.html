        <h1>NHS Programming Club</h1>
        <p>The NHS Programming Club is a club that allows fellow programmers to meet
            and work together to fix problems within our community using computer science.
            In the club, each member will program a specific part of a main, focused project, chosen by other club members.
            The programs the club creates are designed to help the community in some way.
            For example, one of the projects could be a re-design for a teacher's website or a program that helps students accomplish a goal more easily.
            Whatever the problem is, each club member will program and collaborate together
            using <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub.</a> Together, we will make the school and our community a better place.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the club members will have the chance to discuss concepts in different programming languages. Each club member
            will have the chance to share their own side-projects and ask programming questions to other members.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>The club's next meeting is: Tuesday, ???</p>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns, email the club president,
