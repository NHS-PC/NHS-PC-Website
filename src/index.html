		<h1>About the Club</h1>
		<p>The NHS Programming Club is a club that allows fellow programmers to meet and work together to fix problems within our community using computer science. In addition, the club allows students to work on programming challenges together and discuss different methods to complete them. As a club, we help each other overcome bugs we encounter in our programs.</p>
		
		<h1>Meetings</h1>
		<p>We try to have a meeting every three weeks on Tuesdays, but always check this website to confirm. If you're unable to come to a meeting, please email Yuval, and check the meeting summaries page on this website.</p>
		<p>We meet in room 106.</p>
		<h2>Next Meeting: Tuesday, December 23rd after school</h2>

		<h1>GitHub</h1>
		<p>This programming club uses GitHub to allow version control in our code and to make collaboration easier. You can view our GitHub projects by visting the projects page on this website.</p>
		
		<p>To participate in our programming projects, you should learn how to use GitHub and set up your computer to use git. Do a google search for GitHub tutorials, to learn more about Git and GitHub.</p>

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>In addition to coding programs that help the community, club members work on different programming challenges during club meetings. As a club, we think together on how we can complete a certain challenge. Together we talk about different methods and algorthims to use, and if a better language would be suited to complete it. However, we usually use Java to complete the challenge.</p>

		<h1>Technology/Programming News</h1>
		<p>As a club about programming, we also like to talk about news that relates to programming or technology. This includes advances in new programming languages, security flaws, or technology. We talk about the tech news during each club meeting.</p>
