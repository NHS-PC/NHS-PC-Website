		<h1>About the Club</h1>
		<p>The NHS Programming Club is a club that allows fellow programmers to meet and work together to fix problems within our community using computer science. In addition, the club allows students to work on programming challenges together and discuss different methods to complete them. As a club, we help each other overcome bugs we encounter in our programs.</p>
		
		<h1>Meetings</h1>
		<p>We try to have a meeting every two weeks on Tuesdays, but always check this website to confirm. If you're unable to come to a meeting, please email Yuval, and check the meeting summaries page on this website.</p>
		<h2>Next Meeting: Check back later</h2>

		<h1>GitHub</h1>
		<p>This programming club uses GitHub to allow version control in our code and to make collaboration easier. You can view our GitHub projects by visting the projects page on this website.</p>
		
		<p>To participate in our programming projects, you should learn GitHub and set up your computer to use git. Do a google search for GitHub tutorials, to learn more about Git and GitHub.</p>

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>In addition to coding programs that help the community, club members work on different programming challenges, which are categorized into easy, intermediate, and hard. Club members can select a challenge that interests them, work individually, and also discuss and assist each other with programs we work on. Club meetings offer a chance to talk about the language used to complete a challenge, problems that we encountered, and different methods that can be used.</p>
